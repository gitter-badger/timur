# timur: Finite-state morphology for German

This package is basically a migration of a set of finite-state grammars for the morphological analyis of German delivered with [SFST](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/), a finite-state transducer toolkit by [Helmut Schmid](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/), to [Pynini](http://www.opengrm.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Pynini), another finite-state transducer toolkit. The latter has the advantage that it is implemented as a python library allowing for seamless interaction with tons of other useful python packages.
